        ### Setup

        1.  *Clone the repository:*(Skip this step if you've already cloned)
            bash
            https://github.com/Boaz-marube/Totot-Restaurant.git
            cd Totot-restaurant
            

        2.  *Navigate to the backend directory:*
            bash
            cd chatbot_backend
            

        3.  *Create a .env file:*
            In the chatbot_backend/ directory, create a file named .env and add your Google Gemini API key:
            
            GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
            
            *Important:* Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key. This file is excluded from version control by .gitignore.

        4.  *Install Dependencies (Local Virtual Environment - for local development without Docker):*
            bash
            python -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            

        5.  *Run Locally (without Docker):*
            First, activate your virtual environment (see step 4).
            bash
            uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
            
            The API will be available at http://localhost:8000. Access http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive API documentation.

        ### Docker

        To build the Docker image for the chatbot backend:
        (Ensure you are in the chatbot_backend/ directory)
        ```bash
        docker build -t totot-chatbot-backend .
        [8:39 PM, 6/27/2025] +254 111 801617: To run the Docker container locally:

        * -p 8000:80: Maps port 8000 on your local machine to port 80 inside the Docker container.
        * --env-file ./.env: Securely passes your .env file's environment variables into the container.
        Once the container is running, the API will be available at http://localhost:8000.
